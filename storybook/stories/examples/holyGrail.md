# Holy Grail Layout

An implementation of the Holy Grail layout using the grid and layout systems. The maximum content width is limited to the page width and the hight is either the page height or content height, whichever is larger

It has a sticky header. The footer will remain at the bottom if the page height is less than 100% but, as soon as the content exceeds it, it will be pushed below

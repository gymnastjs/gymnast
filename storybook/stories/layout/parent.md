# Parent Layout Height

The `parent` Layout `height` sets a minimum height of 100% of its container.

When `<Layout height="parent" />` is added to the page body, it ensures that the content will be as tall as the page. If content exceeds 100%, it will allow overflow if appropriately.

## Knobs

Increase or decreate the text length to see how the `<Layout />` allows overflow and how the height is always at least 100% regardless of the content.

## Examples

The [Cards](https://gymnastjs.github.io/gymnast/?selectedKind=%20Examples&selectedStory=Cards) and [Holy Grail](https://gymnastjs.github.io/gymnast/?selectedKind=%20Examples&selectedStory=Holy%20Grail) Examples show how combining `parent`, `auto` and `fit` (default height), we can generate page layouts.

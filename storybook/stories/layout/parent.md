# Parent Layout Type

The `parent` Layout type sets a minimum height of 100% of its container.

When `<Layout type="parent" />` is added to the page body, it ensures that the content will be as tall as the page. If content exceeds 100%, it will allow overflow if appropriately.

## Knobs

Increase or decreate the text length to see how the `<Layout />` allows overflow and how the height is always at least 100% regardless of the content.

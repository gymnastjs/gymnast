# Default Layout Height

The Layout Component sizes height based on the content height when `height` is not specified. For consistency with `<Grid/>` sizing, default mode is also equivalent to `height="fit"`.

If multiple default height Layout siblings are rendered, they stack vertically one after the other.

## Knobs

Change the number of `<Layout />` Components rendered to see how they stack after each other.

## Examples

The [Cards](https://xflex.github.io/xflex/?selectedKind=%20Examples&selectedStory=Cards) and [Holy Grail](https://xflex.github.io/xflex/?selectedKind=%20Examples&selectedStory=Holy%20Grail) Examples show how combining `parent`, `auto` and `fit` (default height), we can generate page layouts.

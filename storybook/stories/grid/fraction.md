# Fraction

Fraction-based layout allows to divide the available space without without respecting the columns.

If size `auto` is specified, it will fill the remaining space. If multiple items with `auto` size are placed within a container they will share the space evenly.

You can combine specific sizes (1-12) and `auto` or `fit` values.

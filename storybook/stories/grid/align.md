# Align

`align` parameter determines the vertical alignment. It allows for `top`, `bottom` or `center` values.

Note that while `align="top"` has the same behavior than the default, `align="top"` is useful to break inheritance.

For instance, if the parent is set to `align="center"`, setting a child to `align="top"` will ensure its children align to the top.

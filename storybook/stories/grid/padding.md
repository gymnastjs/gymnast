# Padding

Padding can be set for any `Grid` component. For more information on valid values and exact formatting, check the [wiki](https://github.com/gymnastjs/gymnast/wiki/Spacing).

Also note that while `Grid` has no margins by default but `Col` has a `24px` bottom margin and `12px` lateral ones. These are in addition to any padding.

If you have trouble visualizing the padding effects, set the `Margin` knob to `"None"`. That will show only the effects of padding.

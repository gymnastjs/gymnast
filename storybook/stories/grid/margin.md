# Margin

This example allows toggling individual margins as well as global ones (the ones set by the grid). You can, for instance, define no margins globally but assign margin to a specific element within the Grid.

Changing default margins may result in elements exceeding the grid size. Make sure to check the grid when testing layout changes.

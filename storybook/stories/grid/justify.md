# Justify

`justify` parameter determines the horizontal alignment. It allows for `start`, `end` or `center` alignment of components within its parent Grid.

Note that if `direction="row"` is used, justify applies to the vertical alignment, since it uses `flex-direction` and `justify-content` under the hood.

# Nested Items

Nested items create a new set of 12 columns within them.

For instance, a 6-column child that sets its items size to 2-columns is equivalent to 1-column at the parent size (since 6 = 1/2*12).

Note that nested Grids have no margins unless explicitly set. This is to allow for arbitrarily nested components. When a margin is needed, you can set it manually or use an Item (Items define margins by default).

Play with the knobs to see the behavior of the different values.

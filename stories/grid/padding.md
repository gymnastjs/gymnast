# Padding

Padding can be set for any grid element. Valid values are:

- top
- right
- bottom
- left
- horizontal
- vertical
- all
- none

Additional sides always take precendence so "none all" is the same than "all".

"vertical top bottom" has no different meaning than just "vertical" since the same sides are affected.

To define all sides but "left", for instance, one could do "top right bottom" or "vertical right"

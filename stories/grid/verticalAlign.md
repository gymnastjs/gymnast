# Vertical Align

Alignment defaults to top but center and bottom are also available

Note that while `align="top"` has the same behavior than the default, `align="top"` is useful to break inheritance.

For instance, if the parent is set to `align="stretch"`, setting a child to `align="top"` will ensure its children align to the top.
